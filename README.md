Symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19) are a cough, a high temperature and shortness of breath.

Simple measures like washing your hands often with soap and water can help stop viruses like coronavirus (COVID-19) spreading.

There's no specific treatment for coronavirus (COVID-19). Treatment aims to relieve the symptoms until you recover.

It's not known exactly how coronavirus (COVID-19) spreads from person to person, but similar viruses are spread in cough droplets.

The symptoms of coronavirus are:
- a cough
- a high temperature
- shortness of breath

But these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness.
