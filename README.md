## Online Full Day Challenge
COVID-19 is a new illness that can affect your lungs and airways. It's caused by a virus called coronavirus.

The symptoms of coronavirus are:
- a cough
- a high temperature
- shortness of breath

But these symptoms do not necessarily mean you have the illness.

The symptoms are similar to other illnesses that are much more common, such as cold and flu.

Simple measures like washing your hands often with soap and water can help stop viruses like coronavirus (COVID-19) spreading.

There's no specific treatment for coronavirus (COVID-19). Treatment aims to relieve the symptoms until you recover.

It's not known exactly how coronavirus (COVID-19) spreads from person to person, but similar viruses are spread in cough droplets.

### Problem / Prompt
---
A curfew from 6:00hrs - 19:00hrs has been implemented by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to ensure the safety of the kingdom and cortail the spread of the virus.

As Salamah District in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia has a large population of senior citizen who can't go to the store and compete with the younger citizens to stock up on groceries during the curfew. 

We need some way to get the list of things needed by the seniors and deliver to a location closer to them for pick up.

The King decided to call on the SEI-12 team to develop a web app which the seniors can upload their required `items` and any registered tested `negative` youth can run this errands for them.
